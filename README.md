## Getting Started
Welcome to a fully customizable Minecraft Autoclicker!
Before starting, you will need to install the latest version of Python which you can find [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/). <br/>
You will also need to install [keyboard](https://pypi.org/project/keyboard/) and [pyautogui](https://pyautogui.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html). <br/>
Now you're ready to use the Autoclicker!
<br/>
<br/>

## Using the Autoclicker
You will need to check that all of your parameters are correct before starting the clicker. <br/>
Once those are set, you can navigate to your project directory in your terminal, and simply enter **py auto-clicker.py** <br/>
Or, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can click the "Play" button in the top right.

## Ending the program early
If you need to end the autoclicker any time before your set AFK Time, there are 2 options. <br/>
**(1.)** You can navigate to the pause menu **(Esc)** or to your inventory **(E)** and move your cursor to any corner of the screen. This utilizes pyautogui's built in failsafe, and after a few seconds it will stop clicking. <br/>
**(2.)** You can navigate to a terminal and press **Ctrl + C** and this will also stop the program. <br/>
**NOTE: _the autoclicker will still be clicking while you navigate to a terminal or corners so make sure to avoid important files and items in case of accidental clicks._**

Hope you enjoy!
